A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.\n\nThe study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population. Explore the `students` data using PostgreSQL to find out if this is true and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.\n\nHere is a data description of the fields you may find helpful. The full dataset is in one table with 50 fields and, according to the survey, 268 records. Each row is a student.\n\n| Field Name    | Description                                      | \n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| inter_dom     | Types of students                                |\n| japanese_cate | Japanese language proficiency                    | \n| english_cate  | English language proficiency                     |\n| academic      | Current academic level                           | \n| age           | Current age of student                           |\n| stay          | Current length of stay in years                  |\n| todep         | Total score of depression (PHQ-9 test)           |\n| tosc          | Total score of social connectedness (SCS test)   |\n| toas          | Total score of Acculturative Stress (ASISS test) |\n\nYour task will be to do the following exploratory analysis:\n\n- Count the number of all records, and all records per student type\n- Filter the data to see how it differs between the student types\n- Find the summary statistics of the diagnostic tests for all students\n- Summarize the data for international students\n- See if length of stay impacts the test scores","metadata":{},"id":"359d243a-25b3-4b7a-a27a-ed1d5eca35ae","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"-- Start coding here...\n\n-- Step 1: Exploring the data \nSELECT * \nFROM students;\n\nSELECT DISTINCT inter_dom\nFROM students;  -- Dom and Inter\n\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records, \n        COUNT(inter_dom) AS count_inter_dom   \nFROM students;\n\nSELECT DISTINCT inter_dom,\n        COUNT(inter_dom)\nFROM students\nGROUP BY inter_dom;  \n-- There are 67 Domestic student and 201 Internatinal students\n\n-- Step 2: Create a filter to explore how the data is different from each student type\n\nSELECT * \nFROM students\nWHERE inter_dom LIKE '%Inter';\n\nSELECT * \nFROM students\nWHERE inter_dom NOT LIKE '%Inter';  -- There are rows that contain null values\n\n\nSELECT * \nFROM students\nWHERE age IS NULL;  -- 18 do not have information\n\n-- Step 3: Find summary statistics for diagnostic tests for all students\n-- starting with \tTotal score of depression (PHQ-9 test)\n\nSELECT Inter_dom,\n        stay,\n        ROUND(MIN(todep),2) AS minimum_phq,\n        ROUND(MAX(todep),2) AS maximum_phq,\n        ROUND(AVG(todep),2) AS average_phq\nFROM students\nWHERE stay IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY Inter_dom, stay\nORDER BY stay DESC;  \n-- Summary of results:Max phq score of 24 is observed for International with lowest length of stay of 3 years.\n\n\n-- Next do summary statistics for \tTotal score of social connectedness (SCS test)\nSELECT Inter_dom,\n        stay,\n        ROUND(MIN(tosc),2) AS minimum_scs,\n        ROUND(MAX(tosc),2) AS maximum_scs,\n        ROUND(AVG(tosc),2) AS average_scs\nFROM students\nWHERE stay IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY Inter_dom, stay\nORDER BY stay DESC;  \n-- Summary of results: Max scs score of 48 is observed for International with lowest length of stay of 3 years.\n\n\n\n-- Next do summary statistics for Total score of Acculturative Stress (ASISS test)\nSELECT Inter_dom,\n        stay,\n        ROUND(MIN(toas),2) AS minimum_as,\n        ROUND(MAX(toas),2) AS maximum_as,\n        ROUND(AVG(toas),2) AS average_as\nFROM students\nWHERE stay IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY Inter_dom, stay\nORDER BY stay DESC;  \n-- Summary of results: Max as score of 133 is observed for International with lowest length of stay of 3 years.\n\n\n-- FINALLY\nSELECT stay, \n       ROUND(AVG(todep), 2) AS average_phq, \n       ROUND(AVG(tosc), 2) AS average_scs, \n       ROUND(AVG(toas), 2) AS average_as\nFROM students\nWHERE inter_dom = 'Inter'\nGROUP BY stay\nORDER BY stay DESC;\n;\n\n-- Summary of results: \n-- Maximum stay of 10 years has highest phq (Total score of depression) score. \n-- The longer the stay for international student the higher the deppression.\n\n-- scs (Total score of social connectedness (SCS test)) is highest for 7 years at 44 but followed by a score of 38 with length of stay of 3 years.
